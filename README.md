# Website builder

### Run project locally

In the project directory, you can run: `npm start` to run the project locally

## Features added:
### Sections
- [x] Add
- [x] Move Up/Down
- [x] Clone
- [x] Delete


### Noteworthy Points:
- To keep the UI consistent with original zip html, the initial state is rendered with default values which can be configured by modifying `DEFAULT_SECTIONS` in `src\constants\constants.js`


### issues:
- [ ] 'coming soon' for unsupported cols in add row
- [ ] '+' icon hover tooltip
